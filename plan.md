lets_vote is a react web app designed to provide comprehensive voting information for any address in the United States

flow is as follows: user enters an address, loading federal, state, and local representative information, along with information about the next election and their nearest voting precinct

will load federal first, then state and local (since voting is coordinated by the states, voting information will come with that portion?)

should find an API (or several) to dynamically update this information

would love to dynamically update districts as well, but that's much more difficult

(stretch): if possible, find voting records (probably external link)

I've probably been thinking about this wrong: interesting part is not the google map, but the legislators-map is a nice aside.
